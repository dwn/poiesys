You are a novice treasure seeker. You've been out at sea in a dinghy for some time. A storm arrives, and your boat capsizes. A mermaid offers you waterwings, saving you. You crawl to shore. Due to your own idiocy, you've just discovered the location of a mysterious lagoon in the Bermuda Bowtie where vast numbers of pirates worked together to bury their treasure. All kinds of treasures are hidden there, each one leading to the next. But what miseries might await your fool-hardy wandering?

You explore the lagoon and find your first treasure, a small pouch containing a map. Unfortunately it is a map of the Queens ferryway. You flip it over, finding an ad for the Dabloon Loon Curio Emporium. How odd, coordinates now appear above you.

You work your way to the shop. There you meet the present proprietor, a parrot named Eddy Current. He fills you in on the gist of things here, such as the history of the island and other pertinent facts. The shop has the basic essential inventory items you need to play the game. Eddy likes to collect odd trinkets, such as shiny objects and novelty games. He will trade to you maps and tools for things he likes.

You receive your first item by trading him your water wings, in return receiving a map to your first treasure. You take your leave: “Don't forget your balloon and your flagoon! What does this look like, a saloon? ya cartoon buffoon.”

Following the indicator to your first treasure location, you find a chest with gold for you and a silly item for the parrot. You then return to the parrot for more quests, each time trading him a silly item for a map or tool for your next quest. Your character is motivated by finding gold, gems, pearls, etc. Each silly item you find either for the parrot or a quest, is the real treasure the pirates hold dear, but you don't know that; your character and the user only feel the gold is their real motivation; it's only at the end that they learn about the value of the silly items. The pirates are going to return, and they want their silly items. You meet lots of human characters during your journey - journalist, geologist, archaologists, a hidden colony of anthropologists - each interested in something, but none is attracted by the gold and precious gems to be found around them. You also interact with many animals – glowworms, jellyfish, cave fish, the wise monkeys, and creatures transformed by the sorceress Circe.
